# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system built using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and past ratings.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application script.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv <env-name>
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        <env-name>\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source <env-name>/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the project:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook project.ipynb
    ```

## Model Training

To train the model, follow the steps in the Jupyter notebook . The notebook contains detailed instructions and code for training the movie recommendation model.
